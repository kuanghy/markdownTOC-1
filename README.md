# MarkdownTOC

Collection of R functions I source and then use to add a table of contents (TOC) to my *.Rmd and *.md files. 

Does two things

1. Adds a toc to one file, after the # TOC and before the next header.
2. Can also create a master TOC for a collection of files. This is currently optimized for creating TOCs for GitHub wiki's.

To use the functions:
```r 
source("https://github.com/rmflight/markdownTOC/blob/master/markdownTOC.r")
```

Comments or suggestions are welcome. Will be posting examples soon.
